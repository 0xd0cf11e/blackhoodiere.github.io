It is official! \#BlackHoodie18 - 4th Edition - the free reverse engineering workshop for women - is taking place between the 16th and the 18th of November in Berlin! __And you can be part of it!!__

We are looking for short talks of 20 minutes, longer talks of 40 minutes and lightning talks of 5 to 10 minutes. Workshops duration  are up to the trainer but we encourage slots of either half a day (~3/4h) or a full day (~7h).

The submissions will be accepted until August, 15th. Talks and workshops will be selected and announced on _September, 1st_.

Note that this is a free event so, we can't reimburse travel or accommodation costs for speakers. All the fun is shared with the attendees (even the "speakers dinner")!

Please submit [here](https://cfp.hack.lu/blackhoodie18/submit/).

We are all very much looking forward to it!
