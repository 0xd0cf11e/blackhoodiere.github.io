## Local build on your machine

To fetch and install the dependencies in ./vendor/bundle:

```
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

Then you can build and run the development web server:

``
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The website can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:4000 and the development server will watch the directory for changes and rebuild.
